This is the (official) repository for the (unofficial) Coronado Desktop App.

Sometimes it's just a little annoying to log into and check every single website that different teachers use (all for good reasons too)! Wouldn't it be nice if all the sites, notifications, assignments and calendars where in one place? Now they are. That's what this app if for.

  __This app is still in alpha. It isn't fully functional yet and should only be used for development and testing purposes right now.__

## Timeline

  Unfortunately, I have heard it rumored from multiple sources that Coronado is going to start virtually. For how long I am unsure, but I have heard that it could be anywhere from a couple weeks to sometime in October.

  In any case, and even if we don't start virtually, I feel that the Coronado Desktop App would be an invaluable resource to students. I also wish to make a 'teacher' version that would look similar to the student version at first.

Anyway, **the deadline for the first stable release (1.0) is August 17th,** a week before we go back to school. I know this is a tall order, but here is **the feature list for this version (1.0)**:
- [ ] The user can access common learning websites within the app, each with at least auto-filling of their credentials, if not auto-login.
- [ ] Students will receive desktop notifications when teachers add assignments to at least Schoology.
- [ ] Users can view a calendar which combines all their teacher's calendars together.
- [ ] Users will be able to access Evernote from the app, and possibly even add assignment details or dates from their calendar to their notes.
- [ ] Users will be able to access Todoist from the app, and possibly add assignments automatically from at least Schoology.
