This is the (official) repository for the (unofficial) Coronado Desktop App.

Sometimes it's just a little annoying to log into and check every single website that different teachers use (all for good reasons too)! Wouldn't it be nice if all the sites, notifications, assignments and calendars where in one place? Now they are. That's what this app if for.

  __This app is still in alpha. It isn't fully functional yet and should only be used for development and testing purposes right now.__
